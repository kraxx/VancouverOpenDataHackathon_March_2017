How to build opensesame:

homepage:

-current databases
=> links to a template page that shows a table of the data
	- each open database is stored in our own database and assigned a number (num)
	- clicking on a database links to a /table/${num} endpoint
	- /table checks to see if we currently have a copy of the main database
		- if not, /table pulls from the main source, then stores a copy in our own database
		- from the time of being stored, our copy will last 24 hours before deleting itself
	- changes made by users are stored in a permanent database, named ${num}
	- /table has a "id='table-container' that loads the current open database and then superimposes information from our separate opendatabases according to ${num}

-create new database
	- add information about database
	- once created, is assigned a number (num) which is stored as a new 'collection' in our mongodb


the server:

-database for each dataset
=> create a single mongodb
	- each dataset is a separate 'collection'
=> in our mongodb, make a single collection that contains temporary (24h) copies of source databases
